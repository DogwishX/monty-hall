    <h1>Monty Hall Problem</h1>

    <p class="intro">
      In the problem, you are on a game show, being asked to choose between
      three doors. Behind each door, there is either a car or a goat. You choose
      a door. The host, Monty Hall, picks one of the other doors, which he knows
      has a goat behind it, and opens it, showing you the goat. (You know, by
      the rules of the game, that Monty will always reveal a goat.) Monty then
      asks whether you would like to switch your choice of door to the other
      remaining door. Assuming you prefer having a car more than having a goat,
      <strong>do you choose to switch or not to switch?</strong>
